# Spring-24-DLH
## Manual Setup Needed
In order to run this notebook, you will need to:
1. Ensure that you downloaded it from the [github repository](https://github.com/sjoslin2/Spring-24-DLH).  This means that you should see the following folders:
 - `./mimic/` - Empty folder where you need to manually add the MIMIC-III data files (detailed instructions below).
 - `./saved_models/` - This is where the saved Autoencoder and Score Net model parametres live.  Training these models from scratch instead requires ~30 minutes of GPU time.
 - `./stats/` - This contains stats information around the model training.  If you train these models from scratch then your model trainings stats are displayed instead.
 - `./generated_data/` - This contains synthetic data generated by the model.  If you want to generate your own synthetic data you'll need ~30 minutes of GPU time.
2. Ensure you have added the MIMIC-III data files into the `./mimic/` folder (detailed instructions in the Data sub-section).  We are using MIMIC-III dataset from physionet -> https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/. Please follow the instructions in piazza post #338 to access the MIMIC-III dataset. Download and decompress the following two csv files and place them in the `./mimic` folder:
- `ADMISSIONS.csv`
- `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv`
